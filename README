Overview

This project is an end-to-end analytics case study focused on understanding account growth, churn behavior, revenue quality, and customer support performance for a SaaS-style business.
The goal was to simulate a real-world analytics workflow:

  - Clean and model data using SQL

  - Build a star-schema style data model

  - Create an executive-ready Power BI dashboard

  - Answer business questions decision-makers actually care about


Business Questions Answered

This dashboard was built to answer questions such as:

  - How is the total account base changing over time?

  - What does churn look like month over month?

  - Which plan tiers and accounts drive the majority of revenue?

  - How concentrated is revenue across customers?

  - How does customer support performance vary by plan tier?

  - Are higher-value customers receiving better or worse support outcomes?


Tools Used

Microsoft Excel - The original dataset was provided in Excel format and used as the initial raw data source.

Azure (Data Ingestion & Storage) - Azure was used to ingest the raw Excel data and store it in a structured environment prior to analysis. 
This step simulated a real-world cloud data pipeline where raw files are centralized, persisted, and prepared for downstream analytics.

SQL Server / T-SQL - data cleaning, transformations, aggregations

Power BI — data modeling, DAX measures, dashboard design

GitHub — project documentation and version control


Data Model Overview

The model follows a fact + dimension style approach to support flexible analysis:

  - Accounts fact table - account-level attributes and recurring revenue

  - Monthly churn fact table - churned accounts aggregated by month

  - Support fact table - ticket volume, resolution time, and satisfaction metrics

  - Date / Month table - consistent time-based analysis across pages

SQL was used for:

  - Data cleaning

  - Preparing fact tables for analysis

Power BI (DAX) was used for:

  - Dynamic KPIs (churn rate, rolling metrics)

  - Revenue concentration analysis

  - Interactive filtering and slicing
