Overview

This project is a Power BI dashboard built to analyze the performance of a SaaS (Software-as-a-Service) company. The goal was to create a clean, interactive, and executive-ready dashboard that provides insights into customer acquisition, churn, revenue, and overall customer health.
The project demonstrates data modeling, cleaning, transformation, and visualization skills, with a focus on business-relevant KPIs and time intelligence calculations.


Goals / Questions Answered

The dashboard was designed to answer the following business questions:

1. Growth Metrics

  - How many accounts do we have in total, and how are they distributed across plan tiers?

  - How many new accounts are added each month?

  - What is the net growth after accounting for churn?

2. Churn & Retention

  - How many customers are churning each month?

  - What is the monthly churn rate, and how is it trending over time?

  - What are short-term (month-over-month) and medium-term (3-month rolling) churn trends?

3. Revenue & Customer Health

  - What is the Total Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR), and how does it change by plan tier?

  - How long do customers typically remain subscribed?

  - How quickly are support tickets resolved?

  - What is the average customer satisfaction score?

The dashboard allows filtering by plan tier, industry, and other customer segments to understand performance at a more granular level.


Dataset

The dashboard was built using multiple CSV datasets representing SaaS operational data, including:

    Accounts – Customer details, plan tiers, and churn flags

    Subscriptions – Monthly subscription revenue and status

    Feature Usage – Product usage data

    Churn Events – Reasons for churn, refund amounts

    Support Tickets – Customer support activity and satisfaction

All data was cleaned, transformed, and joined into a fact table model to support both KPIs and trend analysis.
